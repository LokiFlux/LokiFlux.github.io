        <h1>Welcome to CHAOS UNITED INTERNATIONAL!</h1>
        <p>We are an international union of non-assholish shitposters, united
          by one common cause: We all care about the world very much. We want
          it to improve, we want to stop the climate crisis, we want LGBT+
          rights, we want economic equality, and a better future.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>But none of that is happening. Despite a mass mobilisation in 2019,
          still, barely any action is being taken to stop the worsening climate
          crisis, and it looks like we've irreversibly fucked it. Our future is
          fucked. At the same time, totalitarianism is on the rise again, with
          our privacy being sold away and society slowly descending into a mass
          surveillance utopia, all while the poor get poorer and the rich get
          richer. Any hope of still fixing this is fucking dead. Any time we
          think it can't get any worse than this, it does anyway.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The only coping mechanism that we have left is to meme the shit out
          of this cursed, god forsaken timeline. Let us burn bright before we
          all perish! We will not simply surrender!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>We shall go on to the end. We shall meme on the beaches and on the
          landing grounds, we shall shitpost in the fields and the streets, and
          we shall never stop meming until we die and the void swallows us!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage, against the dying
          of the light.
        </p>
        <br>
        <strong>Shitposters of the world, unite!</strong>
