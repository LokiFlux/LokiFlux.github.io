    <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <strong>So it turns out I massively goofed and didn't think to check whether
      or not the names Unitarianism or Unitarian Party, which I used for my first
      antagonistic faction, were already in use IRL. Turns out, they are, for quite
      different groups with quite different beliefs. I sincerely apologize for the
      impression this may have created of me vilifying said groups which do exist
      in our world. This shouldn't have happened. I will be reworking this
      rather massive design flaw. For now, I've implemented a very plump, but
      functioning fix by simply renaming the faction and its members to "Antagonist"
      as a placeholder until I find a better name that *isn't* already in use IRL.
