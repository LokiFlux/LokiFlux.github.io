    <h1>Violence</h1>
    <h4>(<a href="storyMainPage.html">Story Fragments</a>)</h4>
    <p>Boris marched through a door littered with warning signs, entering his
      kitchen. The signs were there for a good reason, as his cooking style
      tended to get a little bit out of hand, which is why, for safety reasons,
      he always ensured he would be alone in the kitchen. He diligently washed
      his hands and started grabbing ingredients and pots. He inspected his
      two cooking racks, which were essentially oversized gas stove elements,
      looking roughly like a table constructed of heavy steel, with a modified
      version of what used to be a flamethrower mounted in the middle. He
      grabbed two massive pots, one a fairly normal cylindrical one, although
      far from normal in its size, the other more rectangular. After placing them
      on the racks, he filled them both with water, using a heavy duty hose
      connected to the fire suppression system. He selected his cooking playlist
      on the installed speaker system, and as a death metal singer started
      screaming at the top of their lungs, he turned on the flamethrowers, which
      instantly covered the bottom half of the pots in bright burning flames.</p>
    <p>From the supply closet, he grabbed a heavy bag containing Seitan flour,
      which was basically wheat flour with most of its carbohydrates washed out,
      leaving almost pure wheat protein. In a large bowl, he mixed the contents
      of the bag with the same large amount of water and started mixing what
      would soon turn into a dough, although with a slightly different feel to
      it, as kneading it required more strength than with usual wheat flour dough.
      He removed the contents of the bowl, slamming them down on the table at full
      force, causing the floor to shake. Memories of Leon's extraction began
      intruding into Boris' mind again. He saw the dirty, self-righteous grin
      of the guard who, as he believed, had just fatally wounded Leon. Rage
      started filling Boris' heart, and he began violently kneading the dough
      by punching it with his heavy fists.</p>
