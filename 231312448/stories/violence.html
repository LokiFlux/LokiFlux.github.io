    <h1>Violence</h1>
    <h4>(<a href="storyMainPage.html">Story Fragments</a>)</h4>
    <p>Boris marched through a door littered with warning signs, entering his
      kitchen. The signs were there for a good reason, as his cooking style
      tended to get a little bit out of hand, which is why, for safety reasons,
      he always ensured he would be alone in the kitchen. He diligently washed
      his hands and started grabbing ingredients and pots. He inspected his
      two cooking racks, which were essentially oversized gas stove elements,
      looking roughly like a table constructed of heavy steel, with a modified
      version of what used to be a flamethrower mounted in the middle. He
      grabbed two absolutely massive pots, placed them both on the racks and
      filled them both with water, using a heavy duty hose
      connected to the fire suppression system. He selected his cooking playlist
      on the installed speaker system, and as a death metal singer started
      screaming at the top of their lungs, he turned on the flamethrowers, which
      instantly covered the bottom half of the pots in bright burning flames.</p>
    <p>From the supply closet, he grabbed a heavy bag containing Seitan flour,
      which was basically wheat flour with most of its carbohydrates washed out,
      leaving almost pure wheat protein. In a large bowl, he mixed the contents
      of the bag with the same large amount of water and started mixing what
      would soon turn into a dough, although with a slightly different feel to
      it, as kneading it required more strength than with usual wheat flour dough.
      He removed the contents of the bowl, slamming them down on the table at full
      force, causing the floor to shake. Memories of Leon's extraction began
      intruding into Boris' mind again. He saw the dirty, self-righteous grin
      of the guard who, as he believed, had just fatally wounded Leon. Rage
      started filling Boris' heart, and he began violently kneading the dough
      by punching it with his heavy fists.</p>
    <p>As he zoned back in, he found the large chunk of dough in his hands,
      sufficiently kneaded. He reached for his battle axe and started chopping
      the dough into bite-sized pieces. After some excessively long, but definitely
      amusing to watch carving, he threw the pieces into the now boiling water of the
      first pot, along with an entire package of bouillon. Into the other pot, he
      poured an entire (compared to his size, comically small) can of salt, and
      then returned to the supply closet for some pasta. Having found a bag, he
      hoisted it up on the table, and cut it open using his one-handed sword
      (which for most people was actually a two-handed sword, but everything was
      a bit smaller in Boris' hands). After emptying the bag's content into the second
      pot, he sat down for a bit to relax. Such violent cooking was exhausting,
      even for Boris.</p>
    <p>After a short break and stirring the pots, the pasta was already done.
      Using a riot shield as cover, he poured out the boiling water. Using his
      axe again, he chopped a 2 kg block of margarine into smaller pieces and
      threw them into the pot. He stirred violently as the margarine melted and
      the pasta started looking more and more like highly concentrated pure
      calories. He placed the pot on the rack again, turning down the burner to
      a tiny flame, just enough to keep the pasta hot while the Seitan cooked.
      To make some sauce, Boris grabbed a crate of tomatoes, and after washing
      them and removing the green bits, he squeezed them in his fists, turning
      them into a fine paste, which he added to the pasta with some generous
      stirring.</p>
    <p>After checking the Seitan pot and deciding the cooking wasn't going nearly
      fast enough, he grabbed a still unmodified flamethrower from the wall and
      drenched the pot in a stream of flames. In his experience, the more angrily
      and violently you heat the food, the more hearty it tastes. To make sure
      the heating occured as violently as possible, he screamed with all of his
      might as he emptied the flamethrower's gas tank.</p>
    <p>After failing to find a backup tank, and consequently just waiting for the
      Seitan to finish boiling, he poured out the bouillon as well, throwing
      the finished Seitan into the pasta pot. For good measure, he reached for
      his sword again to stir the entire meal one last time, before grabbing his
      radio and connecting to the ship's intercom, announcing: "Comrades, it's
      Boris speaking. Dinner is ready."</p>
