    <p>Leon was slowly awoken from his deep slumber by a rhythmical beeping.
      Slowly coming to his senses, he opened his eyes to find himself laying
      in a hospital bed, hooked up to an infusion drip and various monitors.
      Instinctively, he started tugging at the drip, only to be interrupted by
      someone storming into his room. "Hold up, please do not touch that, thank
      you very much." The person, who looked very much like a nurse or doctor
      of sorts, checked the readouts on the monitors and shouted "He's awake!"
      across the room to someone else. "Hi, I'm Phoenix, she/her", she introduced
      herself. </p>
    <p>"You probably have quite plenty of questions, all of which I'll
      be answering shortly. Firstly, you're out of danger for now. You did
      sustain several gunshot wounds to your lower torso, which luckily I was
      able to prevent from being lethal. You will need to stay here for a bit,
      however. The Phoenix serum does have the ability to heal severely traumatic
      injuries, it does however tend to, how do I say this..." She hesitated
      for a few seconds, then adding "have a high likelyhood of causing malignous
      tumours. Now, not to worry, we'll be able to remove any, should they start
      appearing. But we will need to keep monitoring you for a while."</p>
    <p>"Oh, also, where do I even start with that, congratulations for single-handedly
      inventing HRT in your timeline, I'm severely impressed. Took us way longer
      with way more experts working on it, in a world much more accepting of
      transgender people, so, basically, I definitely hope to have some scientific
      conversations with you, if you're interested. We could definitely use your
      skillset." She inhaled and was about to seemlessly continue her dialogue
      when she was interrupted by the sound of heavy, pounding footsteps quickly
      approaching from the corridor.</p>
    <p>Boris bust into the room, his face covered in tears, but with an undeniably
      releaved facial expression. "Thank the heavens, you made it! I was so
      worried about you!" The rest of his words drowned in a mix of laughing and
      sobbing as he tightly hugged Leon, nearly preventing him from breathing.
      Leon hugged him back as well as he could, until Phoenix interrupted:
      "Alright, Boris, please don't make my patient pass out, I understand you're
      glad, but he does need some rest right now, alright?" Boris started sobbing
      again: "He could have died, he almost did. And all of that was my fault."
      Phoenix placed her hand on his shoulder, comforting him: "Boris, calm down.
      Without you getting him out of there, he would be dead by now. You
      saved his life, Boris. Please, don't be this hard on yourself." Looking
      back at Leon, she added: "Right now, he needs to rest for a bit, alright?"
      Boris sighed and replied: "Thanks, Phoenix, I understand. I'll go make dinner."
      He walked out of the room, still quite visibly shaken.</p>
    <p>Leon sat up in his bed, addressing Phoenix: "I honestly don't feel tired,
      I'm feeling fine, really." With a stern motherly tone, Phoenix replied: "
      You need to rest, no discussion." Grabbing some pieces of metal from a bowl
      with a pair of pliers, she added: "Three of these bullets were lodged in
      your intestines, and it may feel like a lot of time has passed when you
      wake up from a coma, but it's been just short of a few hours since you
      were shot by that Antagonist jackass. So, I don't care if you feel fine. You rest.
      End of story. Besides, there's a fairly high chance that you have a tumour
      growing inside you right now. Can't be picky about side effects with your life
      on the line."</p>
