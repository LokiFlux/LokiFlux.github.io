    <h1>The pioneer</h1>
    <h4>(<a href="storyMainPage.html">Story Fragments</a>)</h4>
    <p>On a morning illuminated by a fiery red dawn, Riley marched out of their
      quarters, dressed in a full-body space suit, carrying a helmet in their
      hands and a confident, optimistic smile on their face. It was the day of
      the first ever crewed timelinespace jump, and they were the brave
      pioneer who would venture further than any other person from this timeline
      ever had. Since timelinespace had been discovered, plenty of drones had
      been sent to other timelines to gather intel. Most of them disappeared
      without a trace and hadn't sent any communications since their departure,
      some, however, were still active and broadcasting their findings. After
      the deployment of more sophisticated drones, more and more knowledge about
      the history and sociopolitics of other timelines had become known, followed
      quickly by the realisation that A1621, as the researchers dubbed their
      own timeline, had been distantly more lucky than most others when it came
      to not turning into an utter dystopia.</p>
    <p>Following the collective decision to intervene in the fate of other timelines,
      using A1621's highly advanced technology and society, Northstar was founded
      and quickly received plenty of volunteers willing to assist in its goals,
      Riley among them. After some strategic planning, it was decided that the
      first expedition would lead to B1627, where the Unitarian Party had won
      the great war and subsequently plunged the world into an authoritarian
      dystopia. Due to the physics of timelinespace, the energy required for
      a jump increased massively with the transported mass, making it impossible
      to immediately dispatch a large army to B1627 without a similar portal on
      the other side. As of now, sending even heavily miniaturised drones required
      so much energy that a capacitor array the size of an entire village became
      necessary. An on-site portal would do the equivalent of carving a path
      through heavy, tall snow, once it was built, that was.</p>
    <p>Constructing said portal was precisely the main mission goal of the first
      expedition. As a highly-skilled engineer, Riley would make the jump in a
      compact vessel equipped with highly advanced fabrication technology that
      would allow for utilising on-site resources such as materials mined from
      asteroids to create more advanced infrastructure. They had had plenty of
      time to study their destination as well as their assignment, as the newly
      constructed and even more mind-bogglingly massive capacitor array needed
      several weeks to be fully charged, even with a significant percentage of
      A1621's entire energy production flowing into it. At peak demand times,
      the energy supply to non-essential areas like entertainment media had to
      be throttled, but nobody really had a major problem with that. The
      Zeitgeist was reminiscent of the great war, an entire society standing
      together in solidarity, everyone doing their part according to their ability,
      in pursuit of a common goal.</p>
