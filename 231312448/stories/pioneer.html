    <h1>The pioneer</h1>
    <h4>(<a href="storyMainPage.html">Story Fragments</a>)</h4>
    <p>On a morning illuminated by a fiery red dawn, Riley marched out of their
      quarters, dressed in a full-body space suit, carrying a helmet in their
      hands and a confident, optimistic smile on their face. It was the day of
      the first ever crewed timelinespace jump, and they were the brave
      pioneer who would venture further than any other person from this timeline
      ever had. Since timelinespace had been discovered, plenty of drones had
      been sent to other timelines to gather intel. Most of them disappeared
      without a trace and hadn't sent any communications since their departure,
      some, however, were still active and broadcasting their findings. After
      the deployment of more sophisticated drones, more and more knowledge about
      the history and sociopolitics of other timelines had become known, followed
      quickly by the realisation that A1621, as the researchers dubbed their
      own timeline, had been distantly more lucky than most others when it came
      to not turning into an utter dystopia.</p>
    <p>Following the collective decision to intervene in the fate of other timelines,
      using A1621's highly advanced technology and society, Northstar was founded
      and quickly received plenty of volunteers willing to assist in its goals,
      Riley among them. After some strategic planning, it was decided that the
      first expedition would lead to B1627, where the Antagonist Party had won
      the great war and subsequently plunged the world into an authoritarian
      dystopia. Due to the physics of timelinespace, the energy required by the jump gate
      increased massively with the transported mass, making it impossible
      to immediately dispatch a large army to B1627 without a similar jump gate on
      the other side. As of now, sending even heavily miniaturised drones required
      so much energy that a capacitor array the size of an entire village became
      necessary. An on-site jump gate would do the equivalent of carving a path
      through heavy, tall snow, once it was built, that was.</p>
    <p>Constructing said gate was precisely the main mission goal of the first
      expedition. As a highly-skilled engineer, Riley would make the jump in a
      compact vessel equipped with highly advanced fabrication technology that
      would allow for utilising on-site resources such as materials mined from
      asteroids to create more advanced infrastructure. They had had plenty of
      time to study their destination as well as their assignment, as the newly
      constructed and even more mind-bogglingly massive capacitor array needed
      several weeks to be fully charged, even with a significant percentage of
      A1621's entire energy production flowing into it. At peak demand times,
      the energy supply to non-essential areas like entertainment media had to
      be throttled, but nobody really had a major problem with that. The
      Zeitgeist was reminiscent of the great war, an entire society standing
      together in solidarity, everyone doing their part according to their ability,
      in pursuit of a common goal.</p>
    <p>Entering the hangar, Riley was greeted by a rather large crowd of
      spectators, journalists and fellow Northstar members who had come to say
      their (hopefully temporary) goodbyes. Before entering the very compactly
      designed spaceship, Riley stepped on a small podium and grabbed a microphone.
      Non-chalantly, they spoke up:
      "'Sup folks"
      "Okay so as we all know, the Reds aren't gone in every timeline, at
      least not yet. So basically we're gonna kick their sorry asses and liberate
      everyone they're oppressing. I'm sure you're all really hyped to get in on
      Operation whoop Reds ass, I'll let you know once the gate is open on
      the other side. Don't worry, should be pretty easy, just gimme a few days.
      Love y'all, kick ass, and until soon." With a mic drop, they left the podium
      and casually marched over to the ship, putting on their helmet and entering
      the not very spacious seat.</p>
    <p>As their ship began moving towards the separate jump gate chamber on rails
      in the hangar floor, Riley started checking all ship systems.
      "Riley to mission control, mic check, over."
      "Mission control, we copy. Everything looking good? Over."
      "Confirm all systems are go, ready for jump. Fire her up. Over."
      "Acknowledged, initiating jump sequence. Godspeed, comrade. Over and out."
      "Godspeed, mission control. I won't be gone long. Over and out."
      Alarms began blaring as the doors of the jump gate chamber sealed hermetically
      and the room began depressurising. The jump gate began activating with a
      massive, deep rumbling noise that was downright deafening and intimidating.
      As a heavily distorted image of a black sky lit only by stars started
      appearing on the front-facing chamber wall, the ship's engines automatically
      sprung to live, thrusting the ship forward and Riley back into their seat.
      The front visor of the ship automatically darkened to obscure the sight of
      the hypertunnel that Riley was passing through. Even though timelinespace
      and the physics behind travelling between timelines using hypertunnels was
      well understood mathematically and scientifically, on an intuitive level it
      was still very much beyond any human comprehension, and the sight of such
      higher-dimensional structures tended to have unpleasant effects on beings
      used to living, thinking, and perceiving in three dimensions, such as
      nausea, intense fear reactions, and headaches.</p>
    <p>Even without visually perceiving the jump, the noises and intense vibrations
      of the ship were worrisome enough. Very suddenly and abruptly, they were
      replaced by complete silence as the visor became transparent again, revealing
      a dark, starry sky. Riley had made it. Losing no time, they set a course
      for a nearby asteroid field which the ship scanner had found to be rich in
      resources that would be needed momentarily. The ship Riley was currently sitting
      in was to be only the starting point for the construction of a much more
      massive vessel. Having arrived at the asteroid cluster, Riley deployed
      the very basic drones they had brought with them. The built-in basic fabricator system would process the resources
      gathered by these drones to extend the ship, adding more
      advanced and larger systems that would allow for faster resource processing,
      carrying more and bigger drones, generating and storing more power, and not
      lastly, give Riley some more inhabitable space to stretch their legs. Thanks
      to the inherent exponential growth of this whole process, it would not take
      long to implement the plan of turning this tiny pioneer ship into a sizable
      combat vessel capable of carrying an impressive robot army, which would
      come into play during the last phase of Riley's mission.</p>
