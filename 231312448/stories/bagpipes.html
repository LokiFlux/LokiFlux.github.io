    <h1>Bagpipes</h1>
    <h4>(<a href="storyMainPage.html">Story Fragments</a>)</h4>
    <p>Riley sat across a seat in the vessel's very spacious bridge room. They
      had really made astonishingly quick progress on upgrading and expanding the
      ship, and they felt unstoppable despite not remembering the last time they
      slept. The pure dopamine rush inherent to such quick, constant growth and
      improvement kept them going. It wouldn't need to much longer, as their
      first mission was coming to an end. They were already approaching the
      target planet planned to become the first Northstar Outpost in B1627, as
      well as location of the first jump gate in this timeline. The planet was
      remote, and very rich in resources. Ideal for gathering resources and
      further building infrastructure, while remaining relatively unnoticed by
      the Antagonists. All Riley had to do was take the planet. There was only one
      obstacle remaining: The fact that the Antagonists had also thought it would
      make quite a pleasant resource extraction base.</p>
    <p>However, this precise occasion is why Riley had constructed a generously-sized
      combat vessel, which was filled to the brim with battle robots of different
      types. Strategically, the intel suggested the upcoming quarrel wouldn't
      even be a real battle, as the Antagonists would be massively inferiour.
      Unless they called for backup, that was. It would truly be a shame if someone
      were to hack the orbital communication satellites and injecting faked messages,
      thus not only cutting the enemy force on the planet off from any backup and
      preventing them from warning anyone else, but also broadcasting fabricated
      responses to external communications, creating the impact everything was
      going normally. It would be an even bigger shame if whoever was in charge
      of the cyber security of said satellites was either incredibly incompetent
      at their job, or didn't even take it seriously due to not expecting any
      resistance capable enough to attempt hacking any Antagonist systems.
      Truly a damn shame.</p>
    <p>During the approach towards the planetary surface, Riley discovered another
      pleasant surprise, as the communications satellites turned out to provide
      an almost insultingly easy backdoor into the entire IT infrastructure of the
      planetary base. This would allow for some fun, Riley thought to themselves.
      Searching the media database, they found what they were looking for: A recording
      of a battle march from many eras ago, played on bagpipes.
      Warriors of a historical period long gone by would play this march as they
      charged their enemy, with the goal of intimidating them. This would fit the
      mission quite well.</p>
    <p>Upon getting closer to the floor near the planetary base, it was visible
      from afar that the troops stationed on site were rather confused and in
      disarray after the comms blackout. The ship touched down with the energy
      of a hibernation-ready grizzly bear crashing through a house roof and
      slamming on the floor. Riley grabbed a mic and webcam and connected them to all of the
      facility's speakers and screens. "Sup fuckers", they casually spoke the words of first
      contact with B1627, "Okay, I'm gonna be honest, I'm kind of shocked here.
      Whoever is handling cyber security here needs to get their fucking shit
      together, are you serious with this shit? Your puny satellites were so
      bloody trivial to hack that it's an insult, and I'm not even a hacker, I'm
      a fucking engineer. If the rest of you are this incompetent I'm honestly
      surprised how y'all are still in power. Oh, yeah, right, you're probably
      thinking 'what the actual fuck is going on who is this person?'. I'm gonna
      make it quick, remember the Progressive Alliance? Yeah, basically we're back,
      we're planning on liberating this world, and I'm just gonna have to borrow
      this planet real quick to build a forward operating base for my massive
      army, I hope that's cool."</p>
    <p>"Oh, also, my comrades told me to forward a nice big 'fuck you' to y'all.
      Also, I've heard of how you refer to people like me, so..." Riley took
      off their shirt, revealing mastectomy scars on their chest. "You're about
      to be ended by a degenerate. By one single, chaotic, dumbass degenerate who
      hacked your shit in seconds even though they're not even a hacker! I hope this
      knowledge fills you with humiliation. Also, I'm filming you all, because
      your reactions to this are gonna be too great not to share with the entire world."
      Riley opened the ship's troop bay doors and ordered their army to attack.
      With a few more button presses, they started blaring the bagpipe recording
      over the base's speaker system, as massive numbers of combat robots started
      charging at the base. Riley laughed at the sight of the Antagonist soldiers,
      said to be so fearsome, strong, superior, and intimidating, who were currently
      shitting their pants at the sight of thousands of never-before seen warriors
      ran towards them at superhuman speeds, to the sound of bagpipes blaring
      seemingly from everywhere.</p>
    <p>The soldiers scrambled and desperately tried to repel the incoming attack,
      using their automatic rifles which were somewhat effective, the only problem
      being that there appeared to be more attackers than bullets the Antagonists
      were carrying with them. Some more strategically thinking soldiers tried to
      use the mounted turrets, which might even have worked, if whoever developped
      the turrets hadn't insisted on making them remotely controllable. What a shame
      if those turrets were to suddenly turn against their team, Riley thought to
      themselves, as they were cutting through the base's defense force like butter.
