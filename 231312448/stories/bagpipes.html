    <p>Riley sat across a seat in the vessel's very spacious bridge room. They
      had really made astonishingly quick progress on upgrading and expanding the
      ship, and they felt unstoppable despite not remembering the last time they
      slept. The pure dopamine rush inherent to such quick, constant growth and
      improvement kept them going. It wouldn't need to much longer, as their
      first mission was coming to an end. They were already approaching the
      target planet planned to become the first Northstar Outpost in B1627, as
      well as location of the first jump gate in this timeline. The planet was
      remote, and very rich in resources. Ideal for gathering resources and
      further building infrastructure, while remaining relatively unnoticed by
      the Unitarians. All Riley had to do was take the planet. There was only one
      obstacle remaining: The fact that the Unitarians had also thought it would
      make quite a pleasant resource extraction base.</p>
    <p>However, this precise occasion is why Riley had constructed a generously-sized
      combat vessel, which was filled to the brim with battle robots of different
      types. Strategically, the intel suggested the upcoming quarrel wouldn't
      even be a real battle, as the Unitarians would be massively inferiour.
      Unless they called for backup, that was. It would truly be a shame if someone
      were to hack the orbital communication satellites and injecting faked messages,
      thus not only cutting the enemy force on the planet off from any backup and
      preventing them from warning anyone else, but also broadcasting fabricated
      responses to external communications, creating the impact everything was
      going normally. It would be an even bigger shame if whoever was in charge
      of the cyber security of said satellites was either incredibly incompetent
      at their job, or didn't even take it seriously due to not expecting any
      resistance capable enough to attempt hacking any Unitarian systems.
      Truly a damn shame.</p>
