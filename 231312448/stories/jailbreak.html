    <p>Leon sat in his cell in a Unitarian disposal facility, awaiting his death.
      He was told most people in the same situation felt paralysing fear. He did
      not quite understand what fear was, never having felt any such emotion.
      What he vividly remembered feeling was a profound disgust towards his
      body, a kind of wrongness and disconnect from who he knew he really was.
      Throughout his education, he had learned he would be expected to bear
      children for the Party, raising them as a good mother. He had been
      complimented for his feminine features that aligned well with the Party's
      beauty standards. He had never understood the appeal of being
      a woman, and the thought of being forced into such a life filled him
      with nothing but rage. <br>
      He knew only little about others like him. Others who felt the same way
      about what gender the Party told them they were, had been, and always would be.
      Witnessing some of them being taken away to a disposal facility, never to
      be seen again, taught him early on to hide his true self. Luckily, he was
      naturally good at lying and pretending, though he preferred to avoid doing
      so unless necessary. <br>
      For years, he kept hiding, waiting for an opportune moment, a way out.
      And as his basic education ended and it was time for him to pick an
      apprenticeship, his astonishing skills in biochemistry led him towards
      a career in genetic engineering. The Party required such expertise in its
      never-ending conquest for improving the human race through genetic
      modification. Not lastly owing to their complete disregard for the well-being
      of individuals unfortunate enough to be selected for human experiments,
      they were quite successful in doing so. <br>
      This apprenticeship soon turned out to be the opportunity Leon had been
      waiting for. Learning about human anatomy and endocrinology, he gained
      knowledge on what biological processes caused a human to be a certain sex,
      quickly developing an experimental process of synthesising Testosterone
      by genetically modifying E.coli bacteria into producing the hormone. He
      commenced injecting himself with the synthesised Testosterone, soon
      observing changes like growth of facial hair, shift in voice pitch, and
      increased growth of muscular tissue. At some point, however, he was no
      longer able to hide his experimentation, and was captured by Party agents.
      His fate would be public execution, to stamp out any hope for like-minded
      individuals contemplating going down a similar road. The Party's goal was
      the complete eradication of all degenerates, as they called them, and
      Leon had, by making the biggest breakthrough in transition medicine,
      incurred their particular wrath. <br>
