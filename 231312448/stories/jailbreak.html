    <h1>The jail break</h1>
    <h4>(<a href="storyMainPage.html">Story Fragments</a>)</h4>
    <p>Leon sat in his cell in a Unitarian disposal facility, awaiting his death.
      He was told most people in the same situation felt paralysing fear. He did
      not quite understand what fear was, never having felt any such emotion.
      What he vividly remembered feeling was a profound disgust towards his
      body, a kind of wrongness and disconnect from who he knew he really was.
      Throughout his education, he had learned he would be expected to bear
      children for the Party, raising them as a good mother. He had been
      complimented for his feminine features that aligned well with the Party's
      beauty standards. He had never understood the appeal of being
      a woman, and the thought of being forced into such a life filled him
      with nothing but rage. </p><p>
      He knew only little about others like him. Others who felt the same way
      about what gender the Party told them they were, had been, and always would be.
      Witnessing some of them being taken away to a disposal facility, never to
      be seen again, taught him early on to hide his true self. Luckily, he was
      naturally good at lying and pretending, though he preferred to avoid doing
      so unless necessary. </p><p>
      For years, he kept hiding, waiting for an opportune moment, a way out.
      And as his basic education ended and it was time for him to pick an
      apprenticeship, his astonishing skills in biochemistry led him towards
      a career in genetic engineering. The Party required such expertise in its
      never-ending conquest for improving the human race through genetic
      modification. Not lastly owing to their complete disregard for the well-being
      of individuals unfortunate enough to be selected for human experiments,
      they were quite successful in doing so. </p><p>
      This apprenticeship soon turned out to be the opportunity Leon had been
      waiting for. Learning about human anatomy and endocrinology, he gained
      knowledge on what biological processes caused a human to be a certain sex,
      quickly developing an experimental process of synthesising Testosterone
      by genetically modifying E.coli bacteria into producing the hormone. He
      commenced injecting himself with the synthesised Testosterone, soon
      observing changes like growth of facial hair, shift in voice pitch, and
      increased growth of muscular tissue. At some point, however, he was no
      longer able to hide his experimentation, and was captured by Party agents.
      His fate would be public execution, to stamp out any hope for like-minded
      individuals contemplating going down a similar road. The Party's goal was
      the complete eradication of all degenerates, as they called anyone who didn't
      fit their ideal of a monogamous family with plenty of offspring, and
      Leon had, by making the biggest known breakthrough in transition medicine
      to date, incurred their particular wrath. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The sun had set not long ago, giving way to the darkness of the last
      night before the execution would be due. Leon waited, hoping for an
      opportunity. Just as he was about to lie down to close his eyes, the lights
      suddenly went out across the entire complex. Leon got up and pressed his
      face against the cell bars, trying to get a better view of the confusion
      and disarray that was quickly becoming visible on the faces of the guards
      and his fellow inmates. Most of the guards suddenly left the wing as orders
      to investigate the cause of the blackout were shouted, leaving only one
      behind to guard Leon's cell. Not long after his comrades had left, the
      guard started leaning on Leon's cell door. "Don't even think you have a
      chance at escaping, scum", he barked at Leon in an arrogant tone, "you're
      still a dead woman. Nobody will miss you after we execute you." He spat
      at Leon through the door bars.</p>
    <p>A deafening thunder shook the walls of the cell wing as the guard's
      torso exploded into a red mass of pulp and innards, followed immediately
      by his head. The floor shook as massive footsteps approached from one side
      of the corridor. As they came closer, a simply massive person stepped into
      Leon's view, carrying an almost comically heavy machine gun. "I am Boris,
      he/him", the enormously muscular soldier introduced himself in a deep, but
      undeniably friendly and inviting voice. He grabbed the cell door with both
      of his broad hands and effortlessly yanked it out of the cell wall.
      "I am here to extract you in the name of Northstar. Come with me if you
      wish to survive this night.", he continued. </p>
