    <h1>The jail break</h1>
    <h4>(<a href="storyMainPage.html">Story Fragments</a>)</h4>
    <p>Leon sat in his cell in a Unitarian disposal facility, awaiting his death.
      He was told most people in the same situation felt paralysing fear. He did
      not quite understand what fear was, never having felt any such emotion.
      What he vividly remembered feeling was a profound disgust towards his
      body, a kind of wrongness and disconnect from who he knew he really was.
      Throughout his education, he had learned he would be expected to bear
      children for the Party, raising them as a good mother. He had been
      complimented for his feminine features that aligned well with the Party's
      beauty standards. He had never understood the appeal of being
      a woman, and the thought of being forced into such a life filled him
      with nothing but rage. </p><p>
      He knew only little about others like him. Others who felt the same way
      about what gender the Party told them they were, had been, and always would be.
      Witnessing some of them being taken away to a disposal facility, never to
      be seen again, taught him early on to hide his true self. Luckily, he was
      naturally good at lying and pretending, though he preferred to avoid doing
      so unless necessary. </p><p>
      For years, he kept hiding, waiting for an opportune moment, a way out.
      And as his basic education ended and it was time for him to pick an
      apprenticeship, his astonishing skills in biochemistry led him towards
      a career in genetic engineering. The Party required such expertise in its
      never-ending conquest for improving the human race through genetic
      modification. Not lastly owing to their complete disregard for the well-being
      of individuals unfortunate enough to be selected for human experiments,
      they were quite successful in doing so. </p><p>
      This apprenticeship soon turned out to be the opportunity Leon had been
      waiting for. Learning about human anatomy and endocrinology, he gained
      knowledge on what biological processes caused a human to be a certain sex,
      quickly developing an experimental process of synthesising Testosterone
      by genetically modifying E.coli bacteria into producing the hormone. He
      commenced injecting himself with the synthesised Testosterone, soon
      observing changes like growth of facial hair, shift in voice pitch, and
      increased growth of muscular tissue. At some point, however, he was no
      longer able to hide his experimentation, and was captured by Party agents.
      His fate would be public execution, to stamp out any hope for like-minded
      individuals contemplating going down a similar road. The Party's goal was
      the complete eradication of all degenerates, as they called anyone who didn't
      fit their ideal of a monogamous family with plenty of offspring, and
      Leon had, by making the biggest known breakthrough in transition medicine
      to date, incurred their particular wrath. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The sun had set not long ago, giving way to the darkness of the last
      night before the execution would be due. Leon waited, hoping for an
      opportunity. Just as he was about to lie down to close his eyes, the lights
      suddenly went out across the entire complex. Leon got up and pressed his
      face against the cell bars, trying to get a better view of the confusion
      and disarray that was quickly becoming visible on the faces of the guards
      and his fellow inmates. Most of the guards suddenly left the wing as orders
      to investigate the cause of the blackout were shouted, leaving only one
      behind to guard Leon's cell. Not long after his comrades had left, the
      guard started leaning on Leon's cell door. "Don't even think you have a
      chance at escaping, scum", he barked at Leon in an arrogant tone, "you're
      still a dead woman. Nobody will miss you after we execute you." He spat
      at Leon through the door bars.</p>
    <p>A deafening thunder shook the walls of the cell wing as the guard's
      torso exploded into a red mass of pulp and innards, followed immediately
      by his head. The floor shook as massive footsteps approached from one side
      of the corridor. As they came closer, a simply massive person stepped into
      Leon's view, carrying an almost comically heavy machine gun. "I am Boris,
      he/him", the enormously muscular soldier introduced himself in a deep, but
      undeniably friendly and inviting voice. He grabbed the cell door with both
      of his broad hands and effortlessly yanked it out of the cell wall.
      "I am here to extract you in the name of Northstar. Come with me if you
      wish to survive this night.", he continued.</p>
    <p>"He/him? I don't quite understand what you mean", replied Leon. "My
      pronouns are he/him", Boris replied. "What are yours, Leon?" "Okay I have
      even more question now, how do you know my name, and what do you mean,
      your pronouns?" Boris picked his machine gun back up and replied "Well,
      you wouldn't really grow up with this in your timeline, but where I'm from,
      we're a lot more accepting of transgender folks, and your pronouns are
      simply which ones you want people to use when talking about you. As for
      why I know you, congratulations you have become infamous, not just in your
      world, but across timelines. Northstar have been watching the actions of
      the Unitarian Party for a bit, planning to ultimately take them down.
      When we heard you were scheduled for public execution, we politely disagreed."</p>
    <p>Boris started walking back in the direction he had come from, gesturing
      Leon to follow him. Leon, with a rather confused look on his face, continued:
      "So... is transgender what I am? The Unitarian Party uses different words
      for that. And for the pronoun thingy, I'm a guy, so he, I think? This is
      all kind of new to me." After a short break of contemplation, he prodded:
      "Wait, how exactly did you manage to shoot that guard? The Unitarian military
      has pretty advanced armor. Also, yes, how exactly do we plan on getting
      out alive? There's gotta be hundreds of soldiers outside."</p>
    <p>With a short, hearty laugh, Boris reached into his pocket to reveal a
      singular bullet, handing it to Leon. The bullet was massive, longer than
      Leon's hand. "This is a .50 cal. It is the largest caliber that can be
      fired from a handheld weapon without risking severe injuries." Gesturing at his
      weapon, he added: "And this beauty fires 1200 of these bullets per minute.
      I have yet to encounter armor that can resist that. As for the rest, we
      have an extraction ship incoming, as well as reinforcements."</p>
    <p>As they turned around a corner, encountering a shut security gate, Boris
      reached for his radio. "Boris to Nyx, do you copy? We have a slight
      obstacle here, over." A feminine voice replied through the radio: "This
      is Nyx, I copy. I've been trying, but hacking isn't really my forte. Why exactly did
      we not bring Spectre? Over." Leon was about to turn back to head the other
      way as Boris took a few steps back from the door, replying: "Uhm... that
      is actually a very good question. Don't worry about the gate though, I can
      brute-force it. Over." Much to Leon's surprise, he let out a deep growling
      roar as he charged at the gate, throwing his entire weight against it.
      The sound of fracturing hinges was followed immediately by a cacophony of
      different types of gunfire. </p>
    <p>It didn't take long until the gunfire was replaced by a deafening silence.
      As Leon turned around the corner, he saw Boris on his knees on the brass
      covered floor, reloading his machine gun. "Don't worry, it's safe. All
      threats eliminated." His massive hands removed the spent magazine from
      the weapon, grabbing a new one. Despite the ease of his movements, the
      sheer weight of the magazine, which was several times as broad as even
      Boris' hands, was quite visible. Leon was abruptly torn out of his admiration
      by a loud bang behind him, followed by a sudden, stabbing pain in his torso.
      Looking down at his body, he was surprised to see a red patch in his clothing
      rapidly expanding. As he fell to his knees, Boris sprung up from his knees
      with surprising swiftness. With a loud, angry roar, he charged at the guard
      who had just discharged the last round in his magazine into Leon, and
      finished him off with a single swing of his fist. With a scared look on
      his face, he turned back to Leon and reached for his radio, shouting
      with a worried and broken tone in his voice: "This is Boris to mission
      control, code red, I repeat, code red, get medbay ready, over!" Leon felt
      Boris gently pick him up and carry him out of the room, as everything went black.</p>
