    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Northstar is an inter-timeline task force dedicated to helping worlds from
      less fortunate timelines. Founded after physicists from timeline <a href="../timelines/A1621.html">A1621</a>
      were the first to discover and document the existence of an infinite number
      of alternate timelines, quickly developing the technology to transfer
      information and matter across timelines, and making first contact with a
      transuniversal civilisation. Their numbers and resources were soon vastly
      expanded, as various civilisations gladly joined their ranks in a spirit
      of cooperation and solidarity. This exchange of knowledge, experience and
      culture signified a quantum leap in the march of progress.</p>
    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    <p>"Our extraordinarily fortunate situation has been bestowed upon us not as
      a result of our own actions, strength of character, or nobility. As so many
      other timelines show, it was mainly a matter of sheer cosmic luck. And as
      a society for whom solidarity with those less fortunate is a central
      virtue, we see ourselves obligated to pay our fortune forward. When we see
      atrocities being committed, we will not stand idly by. When civilisations
      cry out to their gods for help, for they see nobody else left to help them,
      Northstar will answer. When all seems lost, we will be the <i>deitas ex machina</i>."</p>
