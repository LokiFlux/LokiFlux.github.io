    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Northstar is an inter-timeline task force dedicated to helping worlds from
    less fortunate timelines. Founded after physicists from timeline A1621
    were the first to discover and document the existence of an infinite number
    of alternate timelines, quickly developing the technology to transfer
    information and matter across timelines, and making first contact with a
    transuniversal civilisation. Their numbers and resources were soon vastly
    expanded, as various civilisations gladly joined their ranks in a spirit
    of cooperation and solidarity. This exchange of knowledge, experience and
    culture signified a quantum leap in the march of progress.</p>
