    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Having suffered under the iron fist of the <a href="../factions/unitarianParty.html">Unitarian Party</a>
    for decades after the initial unitarian takeover following the defeat of the Progressive Alliance,
    this timeline is in a state of trauma, inequality, and agony, even if unitarian
    propaganda may see that differently. Liberation efforts are currently underway, with
     <a href="../characters/lionheart.html">Lionheart</a> leading a grass-roots
    uprising, supported by Northstar.</p>
