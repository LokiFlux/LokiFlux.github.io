    <h1>A1621</h1>
    <h4>(<a href="timelineMainPage.html">Timelines</a>)</h4>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Seemingly graced with plenty of luck, this timeline has experienced a
      nearly century-long golden period of increasing prosperity, equality,
      and liberty, following a decisive victory of the Progressive Alliance in
      the great war against the Reds. Poverty, inequality, and all
      other infamous forms of discrimination have neary completely been eradicated,
      giving way to the development of a deeply solidaric society that focused
      on research and progress, redistributing the previously massive resource
      flow into war towards betterment of all of humanity.</p>
    <p>Among many other achievements, this research uncovered the existence of
      parallel timelines, many of which less fortunate than A1621. <a href="../factions/northstar.html">Northstar</a>
      was founded after this discovery and the decision to intervene in the fate
      of other timelines, using A1621's massive technological and societal progress
      and resources to aid those not yet blessed by the same cosmic fortune.</p>
