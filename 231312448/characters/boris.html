    <h2>Personal Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Operator Name: Boris</li>
      <li>Civil Name: Just Boris.</li>
      <li>Pronouns: he/him</li>
      <li>Timeline of origin: <a href="#"></a></li>
      <li>Date of birth: </li>
      <li>Specialisation: Heavy Weapons Combat, Unarmed Combat, Cook</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Psychological profile</h2>
    <p>Friendly, highly altruistic, and very protective of those he considers
    friends.</p>
    <h2>Specialisation and skills</h2>
    <p>Owing to his massive, muscular build and combat training, he is highly
      skilled at using heavy weaponry. He is capable of hip-firing an M2 Browning
      machine gun chambered in .50cal on full auto, something most others are
      uncapable of due to the M2's straight up violent recoil, which is why it's
      almost exclusively used as mounted artillery. Almost. <br> Even
      without brandishing a weapon, his raw strength and high weight allow him
      to knock out armored combatants or breach lightly reinforced doors with
      merely his bare hands. He is capable of lifting weights surpassing 500 kg
      for short periods of time, and carrying up to 200 kg over long distances.
      <br>Off the battlefield, his passion is vegan cuisine, preferrably cooking
      massive portions to cover either his daily nutrient needs, or to feed an
      entire battalion. He dislikes doing things in moderation in the kitchen as
      much as on the battlefield, opting to cook using flamethrowers, pots as large
      as himself, and going by the mantra "The more violently you cook, the better
      it tastes." He is rarely seen battling vegetables without
      loud music playing in the kitchen, preferrably death metal.</p>
