    <h2>Personal Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Operator Name: Lionheart</li>
      <li>Civil Name: Leon</li>
      <li>Pronouns: he/him</li>
      <li>Timeline of origin: <a href="#">B1627</a></li>
      <li>Date of birth: October 7th, 2005</li>
      <li>Specialisation: Biochemistry</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Leon was born in 2005 in timeline <a href="#">B1627</a>, under the tyrannical rule of the
    <a href="../factions/antagonistParty.html">Antagonist Party</a>. His childhood and adolescence were overshadowed by the
    experience of growing up as a closeted transgender boy, as his mere existence made
    him one of the worst enemies of the state and society, according to
    <a href="../factions/antagonistParty.html">Antagonist</a> propaganda. Most would not have survived this ordeal. Most, in
    fact, did not. The public knowledge that most others either died by their
    own hand or, upon being outed, in a disposal facility for the unwanted, only fueled his rage
    and determination further. <br>
    After discovering a method of synthesising testosterone, testing it on himself,
    and being found out when the changes to his body became too visible to hide,
    he was captured by the <a href="../factions/antagonistParty.html">Antagonist</a> government and due for
    public execution. <a href="../factions/northstar.html">Northstar</a> politely disagreed with that decision and
    extracted him.</p>
    <h2>Psychological profile</h2>
    <p>Basic neuropsychological checkup uncovered partial dysfunction of
    amygdala, causing severely deficient fear response. Likely key reason behind
    abnormally high courage and resilience. Borders on recklessness, however,
    may cause excessive and dangerous risk-taking behaviour. Deficient
    self-preservation instinct. Do not send into battle without backup and
    medical support.</p>
    <h2>Specialisation and skills</h2>
    <p>Above average intelligence, combined with highly advanced mastery of biochemistry.
    Underwent standard antagonist education career, choosing an apprenticeship in
    genetic engineering at the start of adolescence after completing his basic education.
    His skill quickly turned out to be at astonishing levels, seeing as he
    single handedly invented Hormone Replacement Therapy in his timeline and
    successfully initiated a transition completely by himself, a process that,
    in most known timelines where it is possible, requires the expertise of
    several professionals specialised in various fields of human medicine.</p>
