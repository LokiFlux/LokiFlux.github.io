    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Leon was born in 2005 in timeline B1627, under the tyrannical rule of the
    Unitarian Party. His childhood and adolescence were overshadowed by the
    experience of growing up as a transgender boy, as his mere existence made
    him one of the worst enemies of the state and society, according to
    Unitarian propaganda. Most would not have survived this ordeal. Most, in
    fact, did not. The public knowledge that most others either died by their
    own hand or in a disposal facility for the unwanted only fueled his rage
    and determination further. <br>
    After discovering a method of synthesising testosterone, starting a fully
    DIY transition, and consequently attempting to run away and live off the
    grid for a while, he was captured by the Unitarian government and due for
    punlic execution. Northstar politely disagreed with that decision and
    extracted him.</p>
