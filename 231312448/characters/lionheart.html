    <h2>Personal Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Operator Name: Lionheart</li>
      <li>Civil Name: Leon</li>
      <li>Pronouns: he/him</li>
      <li>Timeline of origin: <a href="#">B1627</a></li>
      <li>Date of birth: October 7th, 2005</li>
      <li>Specialisation: Biochemistry</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Leon was born in 2005 in timeline <a href="#">B1627</a>, under the tyrannical rule of the
    <a href="#">Unitarian Party</a>. His childhood and adolescence were overshadowed by the
    experience of growing up as a transgender boy, as his mere existence made
    him one of the worst enemies of the state and society, according to
    <a href="#">Unitarian</a> propaganda. Most would not have survived this ordeal. Most, in
    fact, did not. The public knowledge that most others either died by their
    own hand or in a disposal facility for the unwanted only fueled his rage
    and determination further. <br>
    After discovering a method of synthesising testosterone, starting a fully
    DIY transition, and consequently attempting to run away and live off the
    grid for a while, he was captured by the <a href="#">Unitarian</a> government and due for
    public execution. <a href="#">Northstar</a> politely disagreed with that decision and
    extracted him.</p>
    <h2>Psychological profile</h2>
    <p>Basic neuropsychological checkup uncovered partial dysfunction of
    amygdala, causing severely deficient fear response. Likely key reason behind
    abnormally high courage and resilience.</p>
