    <h2>Personal Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Operator Name: Phoenix</li>
      <li>Civil Name: </li>
      <li>Pronouns: she/her</li>
      <li>Timeline of origin: <a href="#"></a></li>
      <li>Date of birth: </li>
      <li>Specialisation: Medic, Surgeon, MedTech</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Grew up under Antagonist Party and was trained as a combat medic in the
      Antagonist military. During off world deployment, she was critically
      injured and left behind to die by her squad. Having no remaining options
      to avoid certain death, she tested an experimental angiogenetic drug she'd
      been researching on herself. She did walk off that battlefield alive,
      although analysis of her biomonitor blackbox data revealed that she had
      been clinically dead for just short of a minute. Being abandoned by
      those she had considered comrades was the breaking point for her, and she
      fled in a hijacked spaceship, leaving the Antagonist Party behind. The ship's hyperdrive malfunctioned, leaving
      her stranded adrift in deep space. Just days after her departure, she
      started noticing symptoms matching those of a malignous tumour. Despite
      having no perspective of rescue coming, she refused to die, opting instead
      to perform surgery on herself, extracting the tumour from her chest. This
      bought her enough time for a Northstar probe to pick up her distress signal
      during a routine deep space scan, resulting in her being rescued and
      joining Northstar.</p>
    <h2>Psychological profile</h2>
    <p>Suffers from traumatic experiences from her time under the Antagonist
      military. Strongly despises personally engaging in combat. Impressive
      perseverance.</p>
    <h2>Specialisation and skills</h2>
    <p>Primarily works as combat medic, treating injuries sustained in battle,
      predominantly ballistic trauma. Also conducts cutting-edge research into
      new medical technologies. Invented the Phoenix serum that allows treatment
      of severe trauma that would usually mean certain death, by rapidly
      overclocking cell regeneration, with the drawback of being carcinogenic.
      Usually, it would be frowned upon to name an invention after yourself, but
      an exception can be made if you have literally brought yourself back from the dead.</p>
